//! decayfmt command line entry point.
//!
//! This layer only parses arguments and delegates to the module that does the
//! work. It holds no business logic: encoding lives in encode.rs. Its one extra
//! responsibility is presentation, since library functions return errors rather
//! than printing them; this is the single place a decayfmt error is shown to the
//! user and turned into a non-zero exit code.
